# What's in this Dish?  
## Overview
With globalization and increased travel opportunities, people are experiencing diverse cuisines and cultures more than ever. However, this exciting culinary exploration brings challengesâ€”different taste preferences, dietary restrictions, and allergies make it essential to know the ingredients of a dish. Unfortunately, many restaurants do not provide detailed ingredient lists, and social or language barriers can make asking about a dish's contents difficult.

**"What's in this Dish?"** is a machine-learning-powered solution that identifies dishes from their images and lists common ingredients. This project aims to make dining experiences safer, more inclusive, and more convenient for everyone at home or abroad.
