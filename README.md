# Whats-in-this-dish?

Due to a global surge in disposable income and easier access to travel, people are experiencing new cuisines and cultures more than ever before [1]. The phenomenon of globalization has created opportunities for average citizens to experience food from around the world from the comfort of their homes. This gives rise to a unique problem. People have different taste preferences and dietary restrictions. So knowing the ingredients of a dish is very important. Currently many restaurants, small or large, do no provide detailed ingredient lists for their dishes. It can also be time consuming, tedious, and embarrassing to have to regularly ask about the contents of food in social settings. In the case of travel, there could also be language barriers that make this process harder.

In light of these issues our team has set out to develop and deploy a machine learning model that identifies dishes based on their picture and provides a list of common ingredients. In this paper, we will provide details about the model structure, metrics, and mobile deployment of our solution.
